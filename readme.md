# ToDoList with jquery
https://ajitkumarpal1.github.io/ToDoList_using_jquery/todolist1.html

The provided code is an HTML document that includes a navigation bar, a ToDo list section, and some JavaScript code. The code uses the Bootstrap framework for styling and functionality.

## The HTML structure consists of the following elements:
### 1.	<nav>: Defines the navigation bar at the top of the page.
### 2.	<div class="container">: Contains the main content of the page.
### 3.	<h2 class="text-center">ToDoS List</h2>: Displays a heading for the ToDo list section.
### 4.	ToDo list form: Includes input fields for title and description, as well as buttons for adding a new list, clearing all lists, and deleting selected lists.
### 5.	Search bar: Allows users to search for specific ToDo lists based on the title.
### 6.	ToDo list table: Displays the ToDo lists in a table format, with columns for selecting the list, a serial number, actions (delete and edit), description, and title.

## The JavaScript code handles the interaction and functionality of the ToDo list section. Here are the main functionalities:
### 1.	Adding a new list: When the "Add List" button is clicked, the input values for the title and description are retrieved, and a new list object is added to the todolist array.
### 2.	Updating the table: The updatelist() function is called to update the table whenever there are changes in the todolist array. It dynamically creates the table rows based on the list data.
### 3.	Editing a list: When the "Edit" button is clicked for a specific list, the list details are replaced with input fields, allowing the user to edit the title and description. The changes can be saved by clicking the "Save" button.
### 4.	Deleting a list: When the "Delete" button is clicked for a specific list, the list is removed from the todolist array.
### 5.	Selecting lists: Each list has a checkbox that allows the user to select multiple lists. The "All" checkbox selects or deselects all lists.
### 6.	Clearing all lists: When the "Clear all" button is clicked, all lists are removed from the todolist array.
### 7.	Deleting selected lists: When the "Delete the selected list" button is clicked, all selected lists are removed from the todolist array.
### 8.	Searching for lists: When the "Search" button is clicked, the entered search term is compared with the titles of the lists, and the matching lists are displayed while hiding the non-matching ones.
Please note that the code is missing the necessary CSS and JavaScript dependencies for Bootstrap and Font Awesome. To see the complete functionality and styling, make sure to include the required dependencies in the <head> section of your HTML document.
